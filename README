Text-Ignore-BoilerPlate v0.1

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

This installs the Perl modules, and a script called rem-boilerplate-text. 
This script can be used like this

        > rem-boilerplate-text <list of files>

E.g.

        > rem-boilerplate-text intranet/txt/*.txt 

Note that the system only works when more than one file is specified, 
since boilerplate text is detected based on repetition across files.

New files are written, with '.content' appended to the original filenames.
